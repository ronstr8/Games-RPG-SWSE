================

This package contains code to ease the book-keeping aspects of playing the tabletop Star Wars Saga Edition d20 RPG.
I seem to have lost some of my character progress, as he (`KelynLangolier`) is supposed to be a bad-ass space pirate.
There's really nothing technically impressive about what this does, when it even does it.
I just wanted to put it out there. Maybe someone can do something useful with the structure, at least.
It should be data-driven somehow. Maybe JSON serialization of the items along with lazy-build.

I really miss playing that game.
